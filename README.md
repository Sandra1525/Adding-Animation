# Adding-Animation
In this project
 we will create a simple page,
 where a car will
 appear to move on a road. 
The simple project is a perfect
 example of how animations 
can be made easily and quickly.
 Look out for the use of
 <marquee> tag for creating this simple animation. Try adding more objects and making them move in different directions for more fun.
